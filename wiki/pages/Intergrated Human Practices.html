      <h4>Best Integrated Human Practices</h4>
      <p>How does your project affect society and how does society influence the direction of your project? How might ethical considerations and stakeholder input guide your project purpose and design and the experiments you conduct in the lab? How does this feedback enter into the process of your work all through the iGEM competition? Document a thoughtful and creative approach to exploring these questions and how your project evolved in the process to compete for this award!</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.</p>
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>

      "This year, we plan to use <span style="font-style: italic;">iGEM's component database</span> to train an AI model that will use existing components to transform an input plasmid function into multiple plasmids that have the potential to fulfill that function, while giving the base sequences of the individual components in the plasmid, the database number, and so on. We will go through the following process to build and refine our AI model. (workflow) First, we will organize the database accumulated by iGEM for 20 years into the form of a knowledge graph, and use manual tagging to train the AI model to classify and summarize the data. Next, we will use this knowledge graph to build （train?）an AI model, the function of which is to input the desired function of the plasmid, and the model will give multiple plasmids that can potentially fulfill the function, and at the same time give the sequence of each element base in the plasmid, the database number, etc. Our model will also provide a newcomer mode, so that the general public who has not been exposed to synthetic biology can input vague requirements, the model will give multiple plasmids that can potentially fulfill the function, and will also give how to use the plasmid, as well as detailed information about the function and components of the plasmid, which will make it more convenient for the general public to get in touch with synthetic biology and use it. According to the needs of the training dataset and the knowledge graph dataset required by our model, we are going to give a software to fill in the iGEM database in a standardized way, which only needs to fill in the data according to the instructions to make the data filled in the database become a high-quality corpus. In the long run, the iGEM database can become a high-quality synthetic biology corpus database, and the data in it can be directly used to train AI models. This will make it easier for us to optimize and iterate our models, and for other iGEMers or others to train AI models. In turn, this will facilitate the whole synthetic biology to embrace AI."

      <p class="no-indent">(1) It may be affected by environmental factors and the effect is unstable. <span style="font-style: italic;">Agrobacterium</span> has different physiological activities under different temperature and humidity conditions, so it cannot be used in all agricultural areas. In addition, the dosage and effect may be affected in different regions.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">(2) Trade-off Between Yield and Resistance: There is often a trade-off between yield and disease resistance. Energy and resources that a plant could use to defend against diseases are instead used for growth and reproduction. Therefore, the use period and amount of engineered bacteria need to be strictly controlled. </p>
