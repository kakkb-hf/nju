{% block lead %}In the iGEM Competition, we celebrate student effort and achievement. The Attributions form helps the judges differentiate between what students accomplished from how their external collaborators supported them. Therefore, teams must clearly explain on the standard Project Attributions form what work they have conducted by themselves and what has been done by others.{% endblock %}

        "This year, we plan to use <span style="font-style: italic;">iGEM's component database</span> to train an AI model that will use existing components to transform an input plasmid function into multiple plasmids that have the potential to fulfill that function, while giving the base sequences of the individual components in the plasmid, the database number, and so on. We will go through the following process to build and refine our AI model. (workflow) First, we will organize the database accumulated by iGEM for 20 years into the form of a knowledge graph, and use manual tagging to train the AI model to classify and summarize the data. Next, we will use this knowledge graph to build （train?）an AI model, the function of which is to input the desired function of the plasmid, and the model will give multiple plasmids that can potentially fulfill the function, and at the same time give the sequence of each element base in the plasmid, the database number, etc. Our model will also provide a newcomer mode, so that the general public who has not been exposed to synthetic biology can input vague requirements, the model will give multiple plasmids that can potentially fulfill the function, and will also give how to use the plasmid, as well as detailed information about the function and components of the plasmid, which will make it more convenient for the general public to get in touch with synthetic biology and use it. According to the needs of the training dataset and the knowledge graph dataset required by our model, we are going to give a software to fill in the iGEM database in a standardized way, which only needs to fill in the data according to the instructions to make the data filled in the database become a high-quality corpus. In the long run, the iGEM database can become a high-quality synthetic biology corpus database, and the data in it can be directly used to train AI models. This will make it easier for us to optimize and iterate our models, and for other iGEMers or others to train AI models. In turn, this will facilitate the whole synthetic biology to embrace AI."
